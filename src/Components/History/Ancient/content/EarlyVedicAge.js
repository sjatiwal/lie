      <h2 className="text-2xl">Aryans</h2>
      <div>
        Aryans came in India from Eurasia which is east of Alps mountains. They
        came in India in several waves. They came in India through Iran as they
        were mentioned in Kassite and Mitanni inscriptions of Iran. They lived
        nomadic, pastoral life in early phase. They spoke Indo-European
        Language. They used horses, socketed axes, bronze dirks and swords. They
        settled in India on banks of Indus and Saraswati river. Some of them
        settled in Afghanistan also. <br />
        After commings here they came in conflict with indigenous tribe(Dasas,
        Dasyus), pre-Aryans and sometime with themselves. Bharta tribe fought
        and won Battle of Ten King with host of ten kings(5 Aryan and 5 non
        Aryan Tribes) on bank of Parushni river. Bharatavarsha name to the
        country was given based on this tribe.{" "}

        They used horses, chariots, coats of mail, swords etc. which helped them
        in their survival in this reigon. Battles were fought generally for
        cows. Priest were also provided with cows and women slave as gifts. Rig
        Veda mention about ploughshare, they knew about sowing, harvesting,
        threshing of crops according to seasons. They Knew about various kinds
        of crafts such as carpentering, chariot-making, weaving, pottery(Painted
        Gray Ware), metal working etc. We did not find any iron object belonging

      <h2 className="text-2xl">Polity :</h2>
      <div>
        The society was tribal in nature. They had Tribal Chief or King known as
        Rajan. Generally this post was hereditary but sometimes king was elected
        by Samiti which was a powerful assemly of that time. King had limited
        powers and was assisted by Sabha, Samiti, Priest etc. King fought
        battles for protection of their cows. War booty acquired was also shared
        with all. Sabha and Vidatha were also attended by women. Tax collection
        system was absent, King got voluntary offering called Bali. Spies were
        hired for stopping theft and burglary. King did not have any standing
        army. <br /> <br />
        Kula - Grama - Vis - Jana <br />
        Kula was basic unit of power headed by Kulapas, group of Kula formed
        Grama which was headed by Gramini, group of Grama formed Vis/clan headed
        by Vishyapati, Jana was formed by group of vis which was headed by King.

      <h2 className="text-2xl">Society :</h2>
      <div>
        Rig Vedic people were identified by their tribe known as jana.
        Family/Griha was basic unit consisted of many people(mother, father,
        slaves etc.). Society was patriarchal in nature. Son was desired to
        fight in wars. They prayed to gods for brave sons. <br />
        Women could attend assemblies and offer sacrifices. Women also composed
        hymns. Widow remarriage was allowed. Child marriage was absent in Rig
        Vedic period. Marriageble age was 16-17 years. Polygamy and Polyandry
        exsited in this period. <br />
        Varna was used for color. Aryans considered themselves superior than
        indigenous tribes. Society was egalitarian initially but later society
        was divided into three groups known as warriors, priests and common
        people. These social inequalities arised due to different shares in the
        war booty among them. Sudras appeared at the end of Rig Vedic Period.
        This division was flexible and based on occupation of people.
