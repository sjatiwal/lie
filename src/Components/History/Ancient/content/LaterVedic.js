      <div>
        This period existed between 1000-600 BCE. People in this period moved
        from Punjab to Gangatic region. Use of iron(syama/krishna ayas)
        implements helped them in cutting the forest and convert the forest land
        into agriculture land. They lived in mud brick houses and wattle and
        doab houses. They used Painted Grey Ware pottery. <br />
        Mahabharata was fought around 950 BCE in this peiod. But Mahabharata
        epic was compiled in 4th century AD.

      <div className="text-2xl">Polity :</div>
      <div>
        In later vedic period King's power was increased and that of sabha's and
        samiti's decreased. Vidatha was no more in exsistance. Women were denied
        to take part in them and were dominated by nobles and brahmanas. Tribal
        authority started converting into territorial authority. King did not
        possess any standing army. Village assemblies were created for
        administration at local levels. Sangrihitri was appointed for collecting
        taxes and tributes. <br />
        Various rituals were performed to establish kings's authority. Rajasuya
        sacrifice was performed for supreme powers. Asvamedha was performed for
        unquestion control over the area on which royal horse ran without any
        interruption. Vajapeya/Chariot race was also performed. Rituals further
        increased purohita's importance in this period.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div className="text-2xl">Society :</div>
      <div>
        During later vedic period society was divided into four varna and varna
        system become rigid. These four varna were brahmana, kshatriyas, vaisyas
        and sudras. Brahmanas conducted rituals and sacrifices for king,
        agricultural etc. These brahmanas were one of the 16th classes of
        priests. Kshatriyas fought war to defend their people. Vaisyas were
        engaged in activities such as agricultural, artistic, cattle-breeding
        etc. Sudras were treated as servant for other varna and were denied of
        sacred thread ceremony. But some sudras were allowed to participate in
        coronation ceremony of the king. <br />
        Society was patriarchal in nature and father could disinherit their
        sons. Common women's position deteriorated and were considered inferior
        to men. Some women took part in philosophic discussion and queen could
        participate in coronation ceremony. Gotra exogamy was practiced.
        Asramas(brahmachari, grihastha, vanaprastha, sanyasa) were not well
        established, as sanyasa was not mentioned in later vedic texts.
      </div>
      <br />
      <div className="text-2xl">Gods :</div>
      <div>
        In this period Prajapati(creator) was the main god. Rudra(god of
        animals) and Vishnu(preserver and protector) were other important gods
        of later vedic period. Idol worship started, different varna had
        different deities. Pushan(god of cattle) was considered as god of
        sudras. sacrifices took place at public and private levels. But this
        lead to destruction of cattle wealth. Priest got gifts for conduting
        rituals of these sacrifices. Upanishads were compiled in this period,
