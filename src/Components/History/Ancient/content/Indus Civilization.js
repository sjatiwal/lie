      <h2 className="text-2xl">Town Planning</h2> <br />
      <h3 className="text-[1.1rem]">Citadel and Lower Town :</h3>
      <div>
        Citadel was a large raised human made platform where member of ruling
        class might live. It is generally present in the western side. In
        eastern side lower town was present for common people. At some places
        multistoried houses were excavated. Generally houses gate were not
        opened towards main road.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h3 className="text-[1.1rem]">Grid System:</h3>
      <div>
        Grid system was used for construction of the town. Most of the streets
        cut each other at right angle. Towns were divided into blocks.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h3 className="text-[1.1rem]">Great Bath:</h3>
      <div>
        It is a tank inside the citadel. Steps were constructed on its two
        sides. Burnt bricks were used for its floor construction. There were
        rooms for changing clothes. A well was constructed for drawing water for
        it. For drainage an outlet was also constructed. It was used for ritual
        bathing.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h3 className="text-[1.1rem]">Granary:</h3>
      <div>
        It is used for storing foodstuffs. Largest granary was found at
        Mohenjo-daro. In Harappa we found six granaries. There were rows of
        circular brick platforms used for threshing crops.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h3 className="text-[1.1rem]">Drainage System:</h3>
      <div>
        Almost all the Harappan cities had drainage system. Almost all houses
        had bathroom. Water flowed from bathroom to the drains. Generally these
        drains were covered. They also had manholes which were used for their
        cleaning. Bricks were used for their construction.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Agriculture</h2>
      <div>
        Indus river brought alluvial soil every year in its flood plains which
        make it fertile plain. People sawed seeds in November and harvested it
        before May. They produced wheat, barley, peas, rice, mustard etc. They
        might used wooden ploughshare as no ploughshare was found. In
        Baluchistan and Afghanistan Gabarband enclosed by dams used for storing
        water. Cannal irrigation was absent. They were first to produce cotton.
        Sufficient growth of crops lead to growth in trade and commerce.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Domestication of Animals</h2>
      <div>
        Harappan people domesticated various animals such as buffaloes, goats,
        bulls, elephants etc. They used them for transportation of goods, meat,
        milk etc. Remains of horse have been found from Surkotada.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Technology and Craft</h2>
      <div>
        Harappan people were well aware of making bronze. Due to lack of
        availability of tin its percentage in bronze implements was less.
        Various kinds of images, utensils and tools were produced by them.
        <br />
        Spindle Whorls were used for spinning. <br />
        Potter's wheel was used for making shinning pottery. <br />
        Brick-laying, seal, terracota figure, jewellary making were also
        important crafts of Harappan period.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Trade</h2>
      <div>
        Sufficient production in agriculture full fill the need of food for
        others which helped in growth of many crafts in Harrapan period which
        led to development of trade and commerce. People use animals to
        transport goods. They used barter system as a medium of exchange. They
        trade with Mesopotamian and Egyptian people and with in India.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Political Organisation</h2>
      <div>
        There is no clear evidence available about who ruled these cities. As
        temples were not found in Harappan cites it is considered that preist
        did not ruled them. In excavation weapons of war were also not found in
        large number, so they were not ruled by king. So it is considered that
        merchants ruled these cities.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Religious Practices</h2> <br />
      <h3 className="text-[1.1rem]">Mother Goddess:</h3>
      <div>
        Terracota figure of Mother Goddess was found. In which plant is shown
        coming out of embryo. Harrapan worshipped her as fertility goddess.{" "}

        Male Diety was made on many seals of Harappan. He has three heads and
        many horns. He is sitting in yogi posture. He is surrounded by elephant,
        tiger, rhinoceros, buffalo, and two deers. this God was identified as
        Pasupati Mahadeva.

        amulets which were used for protection from evils.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Script</h2>
      <div>
        Harappan people developed the art of writing but it was not alphabetic.
        It was pictoral script in which pictures were represented on seals.
        Harappan wrote short inscriptions generally used for identification.
        Harappan script is indigenous script as it is different from
        Mesopotamian and Egyptian script. These inscription are not deciphered
        yet so we don't know with surety about the political, economical etc.
        conditions of Harappans.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Weights and Measures</h2>
      <div>
        With increase in trade, Harappan people developed the art of weighing
        and measuring things. They generally used weights of 16 or its multiple
        for weighing different products. A bronze stick of this period was found
        which had measuring marks. The art of measuring and weighing thing
        brought uniformity in the market and helped further in trade.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Harappan Art</h2> <br />
      <h3 className="text-[1.1rem]">Pottery :</h3>

        Harrapan people made number of seals of various size. These seals
        contains pictures of many animals such as bull, buffalo, tiger, elephant

      </div>
      <br />
      <h3 className="text-[1.1rem]">Images:</h3>
      <div>
        They made beautiful images by using lost and wax technique. We found a
        dancing girl statue made up of bronze from Mohenjo-daro. We also found a
        priest statue made up of steatite from Mohenjo-daro. An ornamental robe
        was present on his left shoulder and passes under his right hand. Male
        Torso made up from red sandstone was found from Harappa.

      <br />

        They made number of Terracotta objects. These were generally used as
        toys or for worshipping. These consists of animals, birds and humans.
        Quality of these figurines was poor as compare to seals and images.
        These were used by common people.
      </div>
      <br />
      <h2 className="text-2xl">Decline</h2>
      <div>Harappan culture might decline due to :</div> <br />
      <div>
        Decreasing fertility of the land due to increase in salinity of the
        soil. <br />
        Tectonic plate shift lead to flooding of the area. <br />
        Shift in the river course may lead to drought in this area. <br />
        Climate change may lead to change in rainfall. <br />
        Aryan's attack lead to its decline. <br /> <br />
        But due to lack of evidence we can not conclude why this culture ended.
